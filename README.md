By using Jupyter Notebook, i have used the data of cars of different brands describing the following :
- Mileage
- Price
- Body
- EngineV
- Engine Type
- Launching Year
By the help of python and its libraries, i have created some scatterplots and graphs for comparison of various properties of these cars which also describe the data in between.

Also statistical methods like Linear regression, OLS Assumptions and dealing with dummy variables have also been covered in this.
